# hello-world

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

So, a little bit about me. I'm Josh. Sometimes people at work call me *"Juswa"*, which is how you would pronounce my name if you have a really strong Filipino accent.

Currently I do **content strategy** in my day job. On the side, I'm learning **how to code** and also dip a little into **data science**â€”a topic that's been a constant interest to me as of late.

I know a little bit about HTML and CSS, but I'll update this page as I continue my learning journey.

Until thenâ€¦
